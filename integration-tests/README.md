# Integration tests

## Basic guide

Running integration tests requires you to have relayer and sandbox docker images present on your machine:

```BASH
docker pull ghcr.io/near/os-relayer
docker pull ghcr.io/near/sandbox
docker pull redis:7.0.15
```

For M1 you may want to pull the following image instead:

```BASH
docker pull ghcr.io/near/sandbox:latest-aarch64
```

In case of authorization issues make sure you have logged into docker using your [access token](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token-classic).

Build OIDC Provider test image

```bash
docker build -t near/test-oidc-provider ./test-oidc-provider
```

Set dummy AWS credentials and the correct region

```bash
aws configure set region us-east-1
aws --profile default configure set aws_access_key_id "123"
aws --profile default configure set aws_secret_access_key "456"
```

Then run the integration tests:

```BASH
cd integration-tests/fastauth   # or integration-tests/chain-signatures
cargo test
```

### Alternative: Docker Builds/Tests

If instead, we need to run docker build/tests:

```BASH
docker build ./ -t near/mpc-recovery
```

**Note**. You will need to re-build the Docker image each time you make a code change and want to run the integration tests.

Finally, run the integration tests with the built docker image:

```BASH
cd integration-tests/fastauth   # or integration-tests/chain-signatures
cargo test --features docker-test
```

## Profiling: Flamegraphs

To profile code and get a flamegraph, run the following:

```sh
cargo flamegraph --root --profile flamegraph --test lib
```

Or for a singular test like `test_basic_action`:

```sh
cargo flamegraph --root --profile flamegraph --test lib -- test_basic_action
```

This will generate a `flamegraph.svg`. Open this on a browser and inspect each of the callstacks.

## FAQ

### I want to run a test, but keep the docker containers from being destroyed

You can pass environment variable `TESTCONTAINERS=keep` to keep all of the docker containers. For example:

```bash
$ cd integration-tests/fastauth
$ TESTCONTAINERS=keep cargo test
```

### There are no logs anymore, how do I debug?

The easiest way is to run one isolated test of your choosing while keeping the containers (see above):

```bash
$ cd integration-tests/fastauth
$ TESTCONTAINERS=keep cargo test test_basic_action
```

Now, you can do `docker ps` and it should list all of containers related to your test (the most recent ones are always at the top, so lookout for those). For example:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                            COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                           NAMES

Now, you can inspect each container's logs according to your needs using `docker logs <container-id>`. You might also want to reproduce some components of the test manually by making `curl` requests to the leader node (its web port is exposed on your host machine, use `docker ps` output above as the reference).

### Re-building Docker image is way too slow, is there a way I can do a faster development feedback loop?

We have a CLI tool that can instantiate a short-lived development environment that has everything except for the leader node set up. You can then seamlessly plug in your own leader node instance that you have set up manually (the tool gives you a CLI command to use as a starting point, but you can attach debugger, enable extra logs etc). Try it out now (sets up 3 signer nodes):

For fastauth:

```bash
$ export RUST_LOG=info
$ cd integration-tests/fastauth
$ cargo run -- setup-env 3
```

For chain signatures:
```bash
$ export RUST_LOG=info
$ cd integration-tests/chain-signatures
$ cargo run -- setup-env --nodes 3 --threshold 2
```

### I'm getting "Error: error trying to connect: No such file or directory (os error 2)"

It's a known issue on MacOS. Try executing the following command:

```bash
sudo ln -s $HOME/.docker/run/docker.sock /var/run/docker.sock
```
